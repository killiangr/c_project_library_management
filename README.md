# c_project_library_management
The project we have done is a simulation
library management application. The administrator and the
member do not have the same menus or the same actions. She
allows you to add members and books as
administrator and to borrow and return books.
The books in the library, and also those that are borrowed,
as well as members, are stored in databases.
These are in text file format and allow you to accumulate
different parameters as well as differentiate between them.
